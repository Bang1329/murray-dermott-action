Some historical and interesting facts about the study of the Tides, Rotation and Shape of the Earth.

##Earth Tides:
There was a time, between about
1870 and 1930, when not a lot was otherwise known about the inside of the Earth,
and Earth tides were central to solid-earth geophysics (Brush 1996). At the start of
this period, one assumption was that the Earth was almost entirely molten (based
on a reasonable extrapolation of the surface temperature gradient). William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) pointed out that, if this were so, the Earth would move up
and down as much as the ocean would, and the measured tide (the difference of the
two motions) would be small compared to the tidal potential—and it isn’t. Kelvin
knew, of course, that this argument works only for equilibrium tides, and had George
Darwin (who we will encounter later in the section on tidal forcing) analyze tidegauge data for long-period tides in the ocean. These proved to have an amplitude
which enabled Kelvin to deduce that if the Earth had a uniform rigidity (shear modulus) this was greater than that of glass and less than that of steel
