    "For a satellite trapped in a spin–orbit resonance, for example, the synchronous,1:1 resonance, analysis of the averaged equation of motion with the drag term included shows that any libration about the equilibrium configuration is damped to zero and the satellite then rotates uniformly with its long axis pointing exactlytowards the planet on passage through pericentre. However, the full equation of motion contains short-period terms; consequently the rotational motion of the satellite has short-period librations about the equilibrium configuration. "
