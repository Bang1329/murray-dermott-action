# Secular Perturbations
## Author: Daniel Ni√±o Villegas

In this project you will find some simulations, plots and other tools related to secular perturbations in perturbations theory. There's a little package that is used in the notebooks of this sections called *secular*, and it contains (by now) the computation of laplace coefficients and their first and second derivatives. In the future it's expected to contain calculations of N-body systems with secular approximations.
